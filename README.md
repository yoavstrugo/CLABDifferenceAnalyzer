### Use it Faster! âš¡
If you'd like to skip entering the CSE username and password each time, you 
can add the environment variables `CSE_USERNAME` and `CSE_PASSWORD` to your 
shell, and the program will automatically read them!
To do that:
1) Run `$ nano ~./bashrc`
2) Scroll to the bottom
3) Add the lines:
   * `CSE_USERNAME=<cse_username>`
   * `CSE_PASSWORD=<cse_password>`
   * replace the `<..>` with what it describes. <b>Don't add space between 
     the equal sign and the words</b>
4) Hit `Ctrl-S` and then `Ctrl-X`
5) Restart CLion, now you should be able to run the program, any time, 
   without entering your CSE credentials again!
